#####I will be answering the following questions:

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the USA from 1999 to 2008?
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008
3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type variable, which have seen decreases in Baltimore City
4. Across the USA how have emissions from coal cumbustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008
5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City
6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has seen greater change?

there should be a plot for each in .PNG format and a script that creates that file.
